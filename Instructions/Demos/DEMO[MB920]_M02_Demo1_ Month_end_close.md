## Demo 1 - Month end close

1. Browse to the **Microsoft 365 for Finance and Operations** home page.  
    To create a new financial period close in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, such as a month-end close, first navigate to the **General ledger** module.

1. In the top-right company picker, verify the legal entity you are connecting to is **USMF**. If it's not, change the legal entity to **USMF**.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Modules**.

1. In the **Module** submenu, select **General ledger**.

1. In the **Period close** section, select **Financial period close configuration**.  
    On the **Closing schedules** page of our example, you can see there is already a new schedule that was created for an earlier closing period. To create a new schedule, select **New** and then provide additional information.

1. In the menu of the **Closing schedules** page, select **New**.  
    Next, add a name and description for the closing schedule.

1. In the **Closing schedule** box, in the **Create closing schedule** drop-down menu, enter a name. For example, **Feb 2021**.

1. In the **Description** box, enter a brief description. For example, **Period close Feb 2021**.  
    Add the start and end dates for the period as well.

1. In the **Period start date** box, enter the start date. For example, **1/16/2021**.

1. In the **Period end date** box, enter the end date. For example, **2/15/2021**.  
    Using the **Templates** menu, select from previously created templates.

1. Select the **Template** box.

1. In the **Template** drop-down menu, select the template you would like to use. For example, **Month end**.  
    Use the calendar menu to choose from the available calendars.

1. Select the **Calendar** box.

1. In the **Calendar** drop-down menu, select the calendar you would like to use. For example, **5 day**.  
You’ll next need to select the companies or legal entities that will be associated with this schedule. You can select each company individually or use the check mark in the column header to select them all.

1. Select the **Company** box.

1. In the top-left of the **Company** drop-down menu, select the **check mark** to select all companies.

1. Select **Create**.  
    We’ve now created a month-end closing schedule. In this example, many elements of the schedule have already been created by the group responsible for administering the finance system. The Month end template, for example, already reflects the different task areas.

1. On the **Financial period close configuration** page, select the **Templates** tab.

1. On the **Templates** page, in the table, point to the **Area** column to display the accounts receivable and accounts payable.

1. Point to the **Task** column to display descriptions of tasks.

1. Point to the **Due date relative to period end date (+ / - days)** column to display due dates.

1. Point to the **Closing role** column to display the closing role assignments.

1. Point to the **Company** column to display related companies.

1. On the left side of the page, select the **Calendars** tab to see where a working calendar has been created.

1. On the **Calendars** tab, select **Edit**.  
    This calendar has been set up so that each weekday is considered a workday and each weekend day is not.

1. Select **Cancel**.

1. On the **Financial period close configuration** page, select the **Task areas** tab.  
    Here, the high-level task areas have been defined. In this case, these areas do not involve security roles.

1. Select the **Resources** tab.

1. On the resources page you can view individual employees and their assigned closing roles.

1. On the **Resources** page, in the **Closing roles** section, point to the **Closing role** column.

1. On the left side of the **Resources** page, select employee names to see their roles. For example, **Arnie Mondloch** and **June Low**.  
    Each employee can be assigned to closing roles. Closing roles are defined on the Closing roles tab. These are not security roles, but instead help to define an organization’s closing processes.

1. On the left side of the page, select the **Closing roles** tab.

1. In the table, point to the **Closing role** column.
