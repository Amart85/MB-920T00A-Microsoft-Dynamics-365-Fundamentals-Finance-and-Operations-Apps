## Demo 1 - Assigning Learning Courses

1. Browse to the **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources** home page.  
    In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Human Resources, personnel managers can assign training courses to employees. In this example, the company’s new hire, Alicia, needs to be assigned the training that is available to employees within their first thirty days.

1. In the top-right company picker, verify that the company you are connecting to is **USMF**. If it’s not, change it to **USMF**.

1. In the upper-left corner of the screen, select the **Personnel management** tab.

1. On the right side of the **Personnel management** page, click the number directly above the word **Employees**.
